    '''Use branch and bound to solve mixed integer linear programs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array
        The coefficients of the linear objective function to be
        minimized.
    A_ub : 2-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub``
        specifies the coefficients of a linear inequality constraint
        on ``x``.
    b_ub : 1-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
        upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
    A_eq : 2-D array, optional
        The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies
        the coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
    b_eq : 1-D array, optional
        The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x``
        must equal the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
    binary : bool, optional
        A flag that indicates all solution variables are  binary,
        i.e., integer-valued with ``bnds = [(0, 1)]*c.size`.
        Additionally, branches will be created by adding equality
        constraints to the linear program relaxations as opposed to
        inequality constraints.  Integer valued solution (``False``)
        is assumed by default.
    real_valued : 1-D array, optional
        Vector of real-valued constraints, specified as a boolean
        mask. The ```True`` entries in ``real_valued`` indicate the
        components of the solution ``x`` that are real-valued.  The
        ``False`` entries indicate that the variable is
        integer-valued.  By default, the mask is set to all ``False``
        indicating all solution variables should be integral.
    bounds : sequence, optional
        A sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``,
        defining the minimum and maximum values of that decision
        variable. Use ``None`` to indicate that there is no bound. By
        default, bounds are ``(0, None)`` (all decision variables are
        non-negative). If a single tuple ``(min, max)`` is provided,
        then ``min`` and ``max`` will serve as bounds for all decision
        variables.
    search_strategy : {'depth-first', 'breadth-first', 'best-first'}, optional
        The strategy for branch and bound to choose the next node in
        the search tree.  By default `'depth-first'` is chosen.  "The
        `'depth-first'` variant is recommended when no good heuristic
        is available for producing an initial solution, because it
        quickly produces full solutions, and therefore upper bounds"
        [3]_.
    callback : callable, optional
        If a callback function is provided, it will be called at least
        once per iteration of the algorithm. The callback function
        must accept a single `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult`
        consisting of the following fields:

            x : 1-D array
                The current solution vector of the associated linear
                program (may or may not be integral feasible).
            fun : float
                The current value of the objective function ``c @ x``.
            success : bool
                ``True`` when the algorithm has found a feasible
                solution.
            slack : 1-D array
                The (nominally positive) values of the slack of the
                associated linear program, ``b_ub - A_ub @ x``.  More
                slack variables may appear than in the original LP
                relaxation due to additional constraints added during
                the branch and bound search.
            con : 1-D array
                The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality
                constraints of the associated linear program,
                ``b_eq - A_eq @ x``.
            status : int
                An integer representing the status of the algorithm.

                ``0`` : Optimization proceeding nominally.

                The total number of integral soultions found so far.
            execution_time : float
                The number of seconds taken to find the current node.
            depth : int
                What level in the search tree the solution node was
                found at.
            message : str
                A string descriptor of the algorithm status.

    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of integer linear programming solver options. The
        following fields are accepted options:

            maxiter : int
                Maximum number of nodes to evaluate.
                Default: ``inf`` (keep going until provably optimal
                solution is found).
            rtol : float
                The relative tolerance parameter when testing a
                solution variable for integrality.  Default: ``1e-5``.

            atol : float
                The absolute tolerance parameter when testing a
                solution variable for integrality.  Default: ``1e-8``.
                See :ref:`<numpy.allclose>` for more details.
            branch_rule : callable or {'max fraction', 'most infeasible', 'max fun'}
                Rule for choosing the component for branching.  If
                ``callable``, the function will be called like
                ``branch_rule(node, rtol, atol)``.  Default is
                `'most infeasible'`.
            disp : bool

                Default: ``False``.

    lp_options: dict, optional
        A dictionary of linear program solver options to pass to
        :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`.

        :ref:`linprog <optimize.linprog>` documentation.
    x0 : 1-D array, optional
        Guess values of the decision variables, which will be used
        for additional pruning of the search tree by the optimization
        algorithm. This argument is only used if ``x0`` represents a
        feasible solution.

    Returns
    -------
    res : OptimizationResult
        A :class:`scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` consisting of the
        fields:

            x : 1-D array
                The values of the integral and real-valued decision
                variables that minimize the objective function while
                satisfying the constraints.
            fun : float
                The optimal value of the objective function ``c @ x``.

                The (nominally positive) values of the slack
                variables of the associated linear program which
                satisfies all integral constraints;
                ``b_ub - A_ub @ x``.  More slack variables may appear
                than in the original LP relaxation due to additional
                constraints added during the branch and bound search.
            con : 1-D array
                The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality
                constraints, ``b_eq - A_eq @ x``.
            success : bool
                ``True`` when the algorithm succeeds in finding a
                feasible solution (not necessarily optimal: see
                ``status``).
            status : int
                An integer representing the exit status of the
                algorithm.

                ``0`` : Optimization terminated successfully (with
                        optimal solution).

                ``1`` : Iteration limit reached.

                ``2`` : Problem appears to be infeasible.

                ``3`` : Problem appears to be unbounded.

                ``4`` : Numerical difficulties encountered.

            nit : int
                The total number of iterations performed, i.e. the
                number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
            nsol : int
                The total number of integral solutions found.
            execution_time : float
                The number of seconds taken to find the optimal
                solution with integral constraints.
            depth : int
                What level in the search tree the solution node was
                found at.
            message : str
                A string descriptor of the exit status of the
                algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``x0`` is provided and is feasible, it is set as the best
    solution currently known.  This will assist in pruning branches
    that will never beat ``x0``, but the search will still start
    from the initial associated linear program as the state of the
    search tree is not captured by ``x0`` alone.  This means that
    stopping ``intlinprog`` and resuming from the last known best
    solution will still require a search starting from the first node,
    but which might proceed more quickly due to the possibility of
    more aggressive pruning.

    The ``depth`` field of the result indicates how deep in the tree
    or on what level of tree the solution node was found.  This can
    be used to determine which search strategy should be prefered if
    depths are similar for similar types of problems.  For example,
    if solution nodes are most often found at high depths, then the
    ``depth-first`` search strategy may be able to find them more
    quickly.

    The relative optimality gap is reported when the ``disp`` option
    is passed to ``intlinprog``.  When the gap is ``0``, optimality
    has been demonstrated.
